🌦️ Daily Climate Time Series Analysis
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and forecasting on a climate dataset that records daily weather metrics in Delhi. The analysis visualizes key weather trends such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed over time, and uses Facebook Prophet to forecast future temperature patterns.

#📌 Overview
Using Python, along with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Facebook Prophet, this project includes:

Data loading and inspection

Summary statistics and data types

Visualizations of:

Mean temperature over time

Humidity levels

Wind speed trends

Correlation between humidity and temperature

Feature engineering (extracting year and month)

Advanced time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet

📊 Sample Visualizations
📈 Line plots for temperature, humidity, and wind speed

📉 Scatter plot showing the inverse relationship between humidity and mean temperature

📆 Line plot for monthly temperature trends over years

🔮 Forecast of future temperature using Prophet
